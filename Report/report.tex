\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Methodology}
After making a change, the program was re-profiled and the new run-time for matrices of orders 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 recorded, averaged and rounded to an appropriate accuracy across three runs on BlueCrystal. Times are given in the format X/Y/Z for each matrix order respectively and are in seconds.

Mention seven dwarves, look up libraries

\subsection{Serial Optimisations}
Include ones I didn't do

\section{Parallelisation}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}
Theoretical limit
Computation complexity
Operational intensity
Roofline
STREAM benchmark
Scaling
\subsection{Baseline}
Mention compiler and flags, they will be tested again after port
\subsection{Adding Pragmas}
parallel for
look at toy code
\subsection{Profiling}
gperftools, tau
\subsection{Cache coherency/false sharing}
Reduction
\subsection{Reprofiling, overhead of parallel}
\subsection{Libraries, BLAS, NAG C}

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Going Further}
